# Civilian-Trade
The Civilian Trade mod for Stellaris
Note on this testing branch:

Complete rewrite of the code and functionality. 

Planets now have a trade 'aura' the varies depending on size. This aura gives a small bonus to mineral, energy, and food production. The originating planet does not receive this bonus. 
If a planet from another empire is in range that planet receives the same bones as well as increased xenophile ethics attraction. 
This foreign trade bonus is canceled if the empires have closed borders. 
This area is only active when a member of the planets population is a member of the prosperity faction. 

Trade ships spawn from planets with prosperity faction pops. They have a number of 'stops' they can take depending on the population size of the planet they spawned from. 
When a trade ship arrives at a planet it deposits resources directly to the countries resource pool. 

Planet specialization:

When a planet is under one of the resource edicts the ships spawning from them will deposit an increased amount of that resource upon arriving at their destinations. The planets trade aura is also switched to focus on that resource (this stacks with other basic auras from other planets.
