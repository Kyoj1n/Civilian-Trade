# Civilian-Trade
The Civilian Trade mod for Stellaris

Civilian Trade update for 1.5.1

The mod has basically been completely rewritted and takes advantage of some of the new things added in the Banks update.

Civilian ships are now based entirely off the presence of pops who are a member of the prosperity faction. They are also regualr civilian ships 
of your empire. They have set orders they follow. While you can temporary command them to move a bit witin a solar system they will immediatly go back 
to their original course. 

They will only spawn from planets that have a pop of that faction.

Planets now produce a trade aura, that appears when there is a propserity faction member on the planet.

The size of the aura is based on the total population of the planet. 

There is a base aura that gives small bonus to all basic resources. If a planet in another empire is providing this bonus the planet also recieves a
xenophilie attraction increase. The aura and attraction is not applied through closed borders. 

Each of the edicts that you can apply to a planet also have a unique bonus that they will give out to instead of the basic trade bonus. 

Trade ships now deposite resources directly to the countries main supply when they arrive at a planet. The type and quantity can be effected by 
the edicts on the planet they left from. 
Upon arriving they also provide a temporary reduction in consumer goods for the planet.

Civilian Trade for the Banks update 1.5.1

The mod has basically been completely rewritted and takes advantage of some of the new things added in the Banks update.

The biggest change is civilian trade is entirely based of the presence of pops who are the members of the Prosperity faction. 
These citizens must be free and functioning member of your empire to participate in trade.

Features: 

> Trade planets (planets with pop members of the prosperity faction) produce an 'aura' that send bonuses to planets within range (based on population size)
	> Foriegn planets will recieve "Foriegn trade" which includes a small does of xenophilie attraction.
> Various trade auras depending on planetary edicts

> Trade ships spawned from trade planets that run stops to nearby planets 
	> Trade ships number of stops determined by the size of starting planet
	> Trade ships deposit resources directly to the empire upon arrival, along with a reduction in commodity goods for a shot time 
		> Some planetary edicts can influence theses deposits 
	> If destroyed by enemies they provide a small amount of resources to the empire who killed them.

I think this version will also be a bit better on frame rate since the number of ships will be slightly lower ovrall in the galaxy, since each empire will vary more and the ships disappear after they are done with their stops. 
There is still a limit on total per empire to keep it from absolutly blowing up.
The trade ships are also regualr civilian ships that are part of your empire and appear in the civilian ship outliner. You can direct them a tiny bit but they will instantly go back on course.

With the way it is set up curretly you don't have to do anything, it all runs in the background basically. Desicsions you make will affect them but there is no real direct control you put on them.
This also means that it works perfectly with the AI.

*Hopes and plans for the future:

> A seperate civilian trader faction.
	> there are some specific things I'd like a trader faction to want that don't fit perfectly with the prosperity faction.
	> Having the happiness of the faction effect trade ships/bonuses
> Some connection to the unity system
> War damands
> Events



Localizations: 
All of these are just English for the moment. Since so much changed basically all the text has changed and I couldn't keep any of the great translations you guys gave me.
There isn't a lot of text this time around so translating shouldn't be too hard. If you want to help I'll post the localization file in a discussion and you can just post it there.
